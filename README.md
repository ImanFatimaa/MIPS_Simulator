# MIPS_Simulator
This is a MIPS Simulator implemented in C++. It can simulate the execution of a MIPS assembly program, with support for various instructions including arithmetic, logical, memory access, and branching instructions. The simulator has a preprocessing step to initialize memory and label information, and it can execute the program step by step or in one go. It also includes error checking and reporting mechanisms. The simulator can handle both label-based memory access and direct memory access, and it supports the use of registers in the program. The simulator also includes a check for stack bounds and a check for valid label names. The program includes functions for each type of instruction, such as add, sub, mul, and, or, nor, slt, addi, andi, ori, slti, lw, sw, beq, bne, j, and halt. The simulator also includes functions to remove spaces, find registers, find labels, and check for valid numbers and labels. The program also includes functions to sort memory elements and labels. The main function initializes the simulator and calls the execute function to run the program
